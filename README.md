# **📌 Wind Turbine Vibration Analysis**  

## **📄 Project Overview**  
This project focuses on the **vibration analysis of a wind turbine structure**, modeled using **multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) systems**. The study includes:  
- **Mathematical modeling using Lagrange’s method**  
- **Natural frequency and mode shape computation**  
- **Numerical solution of equations using MATLAB ODE solvers**  

The system is modeled as a **six-degree-of-freedom system** with springs and dampers, and results are verified through computational methods.
